        My name is Zannatul Ferdus Rakib. I work as a full-stack web developer. I am really passionate about web development. when I finished the JavaScript Programming course. Here, I developed a strong foundation in web development principles, languages, and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Raw CSS, I built a few responsive websites. For a better user interface, I occasionally utilize Tailwind. Then I develop a project using the DOM and API. I post some code samples and a straightforward JavaScript project on GitHub. <br /> <br /> After that, I successfully completed an industrial training program in web development using MERN Stack at E-Learning and Earning LTD. Here, I can sharpen my Full MERN Stack Development skills.I developed a notion for using the MERN stack for whole website building. a solid understanding of the MERN Stack Technology as well as certain new technologies (such Axios, Firebase, Strapi, and JWT). These technologies have been used in some of my projects. Right now, I`m honing my technical skills.
